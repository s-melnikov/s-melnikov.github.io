# Roadmap

esoTalk is being *maintained*, but not actively developed, by [@tobscure](http://twitter.com/tobscure). Stability (bug-fixing) is the main goal of maintanence. I try to review [issues](http://github.com/esoTalk/esotalk/issues) and [pull requests](http://github.com/esoTalk/esotalk/pulls) regularly. Right now, I only develop new features and plugins for paying clients, and occasionally out of personal interest.

Please read this [blog post](/blog/faq.html) for information about the future of esoTalk.
