# Upgrading

To upgrade esoTalk to the latest version, simply:

1. [Download](/download) the latest version of esoTalk.
2. Extract and upload all of the files to your web-server, overwriting old ones. (Be careful that you don't lose custom plugins, skins, and languages you've uploaded to the addons directory, though!)
3. Visit **your-forum.com/?p=upgrade** in your web browser and watch esoTalk complete the upgrade.

## Troubleshooting

If you are having problems upgrading esoTalk, read the [Troubleshooting](/docs/debug) page.
