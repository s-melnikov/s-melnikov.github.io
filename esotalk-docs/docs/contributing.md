# Contributing to esoTalk

esoTalk is free, open-source software, meaning anyone can contribute to its development and progress. The esoTalk source code is hosted on [GitHub](http://git.io/esotalk).

## Pull Requests

Before sending a pull request for a new feature, you should first [create an issue](https://github.com/esotalk/esoTalk/issues) with [Proposal] in the title. The proposal should describe the new feature, as well as implementation ideas. The proposal will then be reviewed and either approved or denied. Once a proposal is approved, a pull request may be created implementing the new feature.

Pull requests for bugs may be sent without creating any proposal issue.

Additions and corrections to the documentation may also be contributed via the [docs repository](https://github.com/esotalk/docs) on GitHub.
