    <h2 id="singletonpatternjavascript">The Singleton Pattern</h2>
    <p>The Singleton pattern is thus known because it restricts instantiation of a class to a single object. Classically, the Singleton pattern can be implemented by creating a class with a method that creates a new instance of the class if one doesn't exist. In the event of an instance already existing, it simply returns a reference to that object.</p>
    <p>Singletons differ from static <i>classes</i> (or objects) as we can delay their initialization, generally because they require some information that may not be available during initialization time. They don't provide a way for code that is unaware of a previous reference to them to easily retrieve them. This is because it is neither the object or "class" that's returned by a Singleton, it's a structure. Think of how closured variables aren't actually closures - the function scope that provides the closure is the closure.</p>
    <p>In JavaScript, Singletons serve as a shared resource namespace which isolate implementation code from the global namespace so as to provide a single point of access for functions.</p>
    <p>We can implement a Singleton as follows:</p>
    <pre>
var mySingleton = (function () {
  // Instance stores a reference to the Singleton
  var instance;

  function init() {

    // Singleton

    // Private methods and variables
    function privateMethod(){
      console.log( "I am private" );
    }

    var privateVariable = "Im also private";
    var privateRandomNumber = Math.random();

    return {
      // Public methods and variables
      publicMethod: function () {
        console.log( "The public can see me!" );
      },

      publicProperty: "I am also public",

      getRandomNumber: function() {
        return privateRandomNumber;
      }

    };

  };

  return {
    // Get the Singleton instance if one exists
    // or create one if it doesn't
    getInstance: function () {

      if ( !instance ) {
        instance = init();
      }

      return instance;
    }

  };

})();

var myBadSingleton = (function () {

  // Instance stores a reference to the Singleton
  var instance;

  function init() {
    // Singleton
    var privateRandomNumber = Math.random();

    return {
      getRandomNumber: function() {
        return privateRandomNumber;
      }
    };

  };

  return {
    // Always create a new Singleton instance
    getInstance: function () {
      instance = init();
      return instance;
    }
  };

})();


// Usage:

var singleA = mySingleton.getInstance();
var singleB = mySingleton.getInstance();
console.log( singleA.getRandomNumber() === singleB.getRandomNumber() ); // true

var badSingleA = myBadSingleton.getInstance();
var badSingleB = myBadSingleton.getInstance();
console.log( badSingleA.getRandomNumber() !== badSingleB.getRandomNumber() ); // true

// Note: as we are working with random numbers, there is a
// mathematical possibility both numbers will be the same,
// however unlikely. The above example should otherwise still
// be valid.
</pre>
    <p>What makes the Singleton is the global access to the instance (generally through <code>MySingleton.getInstance()</code>) as we don't (at least in static languages) call <code>new MySingleton()</code> directly. This is however possible in JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In the GoF book, the <i>applicability</i> of the Singleton pattern is described as follows:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>There must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point.</li>
        <li>When the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing, and clients should be able to use an extended instance without modifying their code.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The second of these points refers to a case where we might need code such as:</p>
    <pre>
mySingleton.getInstance = function(){
if ( this._instance == null ) {
  if ( isFoo() ) {
     this._instance = new FooSingleton();
  } else {
     this._instance = new BasicSingleton();
  }
}
return this._instance;
};
</pre>
    <p>Here, <code>getInstance</code> becomes a little like a Factory method and we don't need to update each point in our code accessing it. <code>FooSingleton</code> above would be a subclass of <code>BasicSingleton</code> and implement the same interface.</p>
    <p>Why is deferring execution considered important for a Singleton?:</p>
    <blockquote>In C++ it serves to isolate from the unpredictability of the order of dynamic initialization, returning control to the programmer.</blockquote>
    <p>It is important to note the difference between a static instance of a class (object) and a Singleton: whilst a Singleton can be implemented as a static instance, it can also be constructed lazily, without the need for resources nor memory until this is actually needed.</p>
    <p>If we have a static object that can be initialized directly, we need to ensure the code is always executed in the same order (e.g in case <code>objCar</code> needs <code>objWheel</code> during its initialization) and this doesn't scale when you have a large number of source files.</p>
    <p>Both Singletons and static objects are useful but they shouldn't be overused - the same way in which we shouldn't overuse other patterns.</p>
    <p>In practice, the Singleton pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate others across a system. Here is one example with the pattern being used in this context:</p>
    <pre>
var SingletonTester = (function () {

  // options: an object containing configuration options for the singleton
  // e.g var options = { name: "test", pointX: 5};
  function Singleton( options ) {

    // set options to the options supplied
    // or an empty object if none are provided
    options = options || {};

    // set some properties for our singleton
    this.name = "SingletonTester";

    this.pointX = options.pointX || 6;
    this.pointY = options.pointY || 10;
  }

  // our instance holder
  var instance;

  // an emulation of static variables and methods
  var _static = {

    name: "SingletonTester",

    // Method for getting an instance. It returns
    // a singleton instance of a singleton object
    getInstance: function( options ) {
      if ( instance === undefined ) {
        instance = new Singleton( options );
      }

      return instance;
    }
  };

  return _static;
})();

var singletonTest = SingletonTester.getInstance({
  pointX: 5
});

// Log the output of pointX just to verify it is correct
// Outputs: 5
console.log( singletonTest.pointX );
</pre>
    <p>Whilst the Singleton has valid uses, often when we find ourselves needing it in JavaScript it's a sign that we may need to re-evaluate our design.</p>
    <p>They're often an indication that modules in a system are either tightly coupled or that logic is overly spread across multiple parts of a codebase. Singletons can be more difficult to test due to issues ranging from hidden dependencies, the difficulty in creating multiple instances, difficulty in stubbing dependencies and so on.</p>
    <p>Miller Medeiros has previously recommended <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/co-single/index.html">this</a> excellent article on the Singleton and its various issues for further reading as well as the comments to <a href="http://misko.hevery.com/2008/10/21/dependency-injection-myth-reference-passing/">this</a> article, discussing how Singletons can increase tight coupling. I'm happy to second these recommendations as both pieces raise many important points about this pattern that are also worth noting.</p>
