    <p>In my early experiences of learning about design patterns, I personally found the following table a very useful reminder of what a number of patterns has to offer - it covers the 23 Design Patterns mentioned by the GoF. The original table was summarized by Elyse Nielsen back in 2004 and I've modified it where necessary to suit our discussion in this section of the book.</p>
    <p>I recommend using this table as reference, but do remember that there are a number of additional patterns that are not mentioned here but will be discussed later in the book.</p>
    <h3>A brief note on classes</h3>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> ES2015 introduced native support for classes to JavaScript, however, they are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance model. We will not be covering ES2015 classes in this book, but <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">MDN</a> has an excellent introduction to them. </p>
    <p>Keep in mind that there will be patterns in this table that reference the concept of "classes". In ES5, JavaScript is a class-less language, however classes can be simulated using functions.</p>
    <p>The most common approach to achieving this is by defining a JavaScript function where we then create an object using the <code>new</code> keyword. <code>this</code> can be used to help define new properties and methods for the object as follows:</p>
    <pre>
// A car "class"
function Car( model ) {

  this.model = model;
  this.color = "silver";
  this.year = "2012";

  this.getInfo = function () {
    return this.model + " " + this.year;
  };

}
</pre>
    <p>We can then instantiate the object using the Car constructor we defined above like this:</p>
<pre>
var myCar = new Car("ford");

myCar.year = "2010";

console.log( myCar.getInfo() );
</pre>
      <p>For more ways to define "classes" using JavaScript, see Stoyan Stefanov's useful <a href="http://www.phpied.com/3-ways-to-define-a-javascript-class/">post</a> on them.</p>
      <p>Let us now proceed to review the table.</p>
